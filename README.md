# Example of a multi-module C++ project with CMake

- CMake multi-module project
- Tests via `Catch2`

## Description 

Toy banking-system application is used in the example.

## Build

```bash
./build.sh --clean
```

Run tests:
```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

## Run application

```bash
./build/application/bank-system
```

## Project structure

Each module has it's own CMakeLists.txt. There are examples of different build targets:

- `account` module is built as a static library
- `application` module is built as an executable
- `test` module is built as an executable (main function is generated by `Catch2` testing library)
